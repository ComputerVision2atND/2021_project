# Helping scripts for data capture

## Individual objects capture

This script can help collecting the data if you're using a camera plugged in your computer:

```
python object_capture.py
```

## Tote capture

This script will create the file structure expected for tote captures: Layout > Lighting > Views.

```
python mkdirs_totes.py
```
